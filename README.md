<b> Daily Notes Creator </b>

This is a simple Python script that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating daily notes. The script allows you to specify a title, select a format (txt, sh or py), and enter the content for the note. The note is then saved in a folder of your choice.

<b> Prerequisites </b>

You need to have Python installed on your system. The script uses the tkinter library for creating the GUI.

<b>How to Use</b>

Download or copy the create_note.py script to your computer.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the script.

Run the script by executing the following command:

<b> python create_note.py </b>

The GUI window will open. Fill in the note title, select the format, and enter the content of the note in the provided text field.

Click the "Create Note" button. A file dialog will appear, allowing you to choose a folder to save the note.

Once you select the folder and save the note, the status label will display whether the note was successfully created or not.
